# Workflow Plan: Add User Authentication

## Overview

Implement comprehensive user authentication system with multiple providers, secure session management, and role-based access control.

## Current Status

- âœ… Quality assurance pipeline implemented
- âœ… Jules automated issue resolution configured
- âœ… Snyk security integration added
- ðŸ”„ Ready for push (blocked by secret scanning - resolved)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation

**Priority: High**

- [x] Set up authentication database schema
- [x] Implement JWT token management (OAuth via OpenAuth.js)
- [x] Create user registration/login endpoints (OAuth providers)
- [x] Add password hashing and validation (email/password auth)

### Phase 2: OAuth Integration

**Priority: High**

- [ ] Google OAuth provider integration
- [ ] GitHub OAuth provider integration
- [ ] Microsoft OAuth provider integration
- [ ] Social login UI components

### Phase 3: Security Features

**Priority: High**

- [ ] Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Account lockout protection
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Email verification system

### Phase 4: Session Management

**Priority: Medium**

- [ ] Redis session store implementation
- [ ] Session timeout configuration
- [ ] Concurrent session limits
- [ ] Session invalidation on logout

### Phase 5: Role-Based Access Control

**Priority: Medium**

- [ ] User roles and permissions system
- [ ] Admin dashboard for user management
- [ ] API endpoint protection middleware
- [ ] Frontend route guards

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation

**Priority: Medium**

- [ ] Unit tests for auth logic
- [ ] Integration tests for OAuth flows
- [ ] API documentation updates
- [ ] User authentication guides

## Dependencies

- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Session Store: Redis
- Email Service: SendGrid/Nodemailer
- OAuth Libraries: NextAuth.js or Passport.js

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: OAuth provider configuration errors
- **Medium Risk**: Session management vulnerabilities
- **Low Risk**: UI component integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can register/login with email/password
- [ ] OAuth login works for all configured providers
- [ ] Password reset flow functions correctly
- [ ] Admin can manage user roles and permissions
- [ ] All auth endpoints are rate-limited and secure
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 1-2 days
- Phase 4: 1 day
- Phase 5: 2-3 days
- Phase 6: 1-2 days

**Total Estimated Time: 8-13 days**

## Next Steps

1. Complete push of current workflow automation changes
2. Install Snyk GitHub App
3. Begin Phase 1 of authentication implementation
4. Set up development environment for auth features
