title: MCP servers
---

OpenCode implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend its capabilities through external tools. MCP provides a standardized way for the AI assistant to interact with external services and tools.

### MCP Features

- **External Tool Integration**: Connect to external tools and services via a standardized protocol
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatically discover available tools from MCP servers
- **Multiple Connection Types**:
  - **Stdio**: Communicate with tools via standard input/output
  - **SSE**: Communicate with tools via Server-Sent Events
- **Security**: Permission system for controlling access to MCP tools

### Configuring MCP Servers

MCP servers are defined in the configuration file under the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "example": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "path/to/mcp-server",
      "env": [],
      "args": []
    },
    "web-example": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Tool Usage

Once configured, MCP tools are automatically available to the AI assistant alongside built-in tools. They follow the same permission model as other tools, requiring user approval before execution.
