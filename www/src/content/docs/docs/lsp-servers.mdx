title: LSP servers
---

OpenCode integrates with Language Server Protocol to provide code intelligence features across multiple programming languages.

### LSP Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Connect to language servers for different programming languages
- **Diagnostics**: Receive error checking and linting information
- **File Watching**: Automatically notify language servers of file changes

### Configuring LSP

Language servers are configured in the configuration file under the `lsp` section:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "gopls"
    },
    "typescript": {
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    }
  }
}

### LSP Integration with AI

The AI assistant can access LSP features through the `diagnostics` tool, allowing it to:

- Check for errors in your code
- Suggest fixes based on diagnostics

While the LSP client implementation supports the full LSP protocol (including completions, hover, definition, etc.), currently only diagnostics are exposed to the AI assistant.
