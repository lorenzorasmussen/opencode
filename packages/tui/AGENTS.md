# TUI Agent Guidelines

## Style

- prefer single word variable names
- avoid try catch where possible - prefer to let exceptions bubble up
- avoid else statements where possible
- prefer Bun apis

## Workflow

- you can regenerate the golang sdk by calling ./scripts/stainless.ts
- we use bun for everything
