To debug any issues with opencode, you can check the logs or the session data
that it stores locally.

---

### Logs

Log files are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opencode\log\`

Log files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2025-01-09T123456.log`) and the most recent 10 log files are kept.

You can configure the log level in your [config file](/docs/config#logging) to get more detailed debug information.

---

### Storage

opencode stores session data and other application data on disk at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/opencode/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opencode\`

This directory contains:

- `auth.json` - Authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens
- `log/` - Application logs
- `project/` - Project-specific data like session and message data
  - If the project is within a Git repo, it is stored in `./<project-slug>/storage/`
  - If it is not a Git repo, it is stored in `./global/storage/`
