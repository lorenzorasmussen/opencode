title: Config
description: Using the opencode JSON config.
---

You can configure opencode using a JSON config file that can be placed in:

- Globally under `~/.config/opencode/config.json`.
- Your project root under `opencode.json`. This is safe to be checked into Git and uses the same schema as the global one.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "theme": "opencode",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "autoshare": false,
  "autoupdate": true
}
```

In most cases, you'll want to use the global config for things like themes, providers, or keybinds. Having a config per project is useful if you are using different providers for your company.

When opencode starts up, it looks for a config file in the current directory or traverse up to the nearest Git directory.

---

## Variable substitution

You can use variable substitution in your config files to reference environment variables and file contents.

### Environment variables

Use `{env:VARIABLE_NAME}` to substitute environment variables:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "{env:OPENCODE_MODEL}",
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

If the environment variable is not set, it will be replaced with an empty string.

### File contents

Use `{file:path/to/file}` to substitute the contents of a file:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "instructions": ["{file:./custom-instructions.md}"],
  "provider": {
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "{file:~/.secrets/openai-key}"
    }
  }
}
```

File paths can be:

- Relative to the config file directory
- Absolute paths (starting with `/` or `~`)

This is useful for:

- Keeping sensitive data like API keys in separate files
- Including large instruction files without cluttering your config
- Sharing common configuration snippets across multiple config files

---

## Schema

The config file has a schema that's defined in [**`opencode.ai/config.json`**](https://opencode.ai/config.json).

Your editor should be able to validate and autocomplete based on the schema.

---

### Models

You can configure the providers and models you want to use in your opencode config through the `provider` and `model` options.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {},
  "model": ""
}
```

[Learn more here](/docs/models).

---

### Themes

You can configure the theme you want to use in your opencode config through the `theme` option.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "theme": ""
}
```

[Learn more here](/docs/themes).

---

### Logging

Logs are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opencode\log\`

You can configure the minimum log level through the `log_level` option.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

With the following options:

| Level   | Description                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `DEBUG` | All messages including debug information |
| `INFO`  | Informational messages and above         |
| `WARN`  | Warnings and errors only                 |
| `ERROR` | Errors only                              |

The **default** log level is `INFO`. If you are running opencode locally in
development mode it's set to `DEBUG`.

---

### Keybinds

You can customize your keybinds through the `keybinds` option.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "keybinds": {}
}
```

[Learn more here](/docs/keybinds).

---

### MCP servers

You can configure MCP servers you want to use through the `mcp` option.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {}
}
```

[Learn more here](/docs/mcp-servers).

---

### Disabled providers

You can disable providers that are loaded automatically through the `disabled_providers` option. This is useful when you want to prevent certain providers from being loaded even if their credentials are available.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "disabled_providers": ["openai", "gemini"]
}
```

The `disabled_providers` option accepts an array of provider IDs. When a provider is disabled:

- It won't be loaded even if environment variables are set
- It won't be loaded even if API keys are configured through `opencode auth login`
- The provider's models won't appear in the model selection list
