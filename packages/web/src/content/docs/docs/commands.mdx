description: Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.
---

Define custom commands to automate repetitive coding tasks.

---

## Create command files

Create markdown files in the `command/` directory to define custom commands.

Create `.opencode/command/test.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/test.md"
---
description: Run tests with coverage
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name.

```bash frame="none"
"/test"
```

---

## Use arguments

Pass arguments to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

Create `.opencode/command/component.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/component.md"
---
description: Create a new component
---

Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.
Include proper typing and basic structure.
```

Run the command with arguments:

```bash frame="none"
"/component Button"
```

---

## Inject shell output

Use `!command` to inject shell command output into your prompt.

Create `.opencode/command/analyze-coverage.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/analyze-coverage.md"
---
description: Analyze test coverage
---

Here are the current test results:
`!npm test`

Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.
```

Create `.opencode/command/review-changes.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/review-changes.md"
---
description: Review recent changes
---

Recent git commits:
`!git log --oneline -10`

Review these changes and suggest any improvements.
```

Commands run in your project's root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

---

## Reference files

Include files in your command using `@` followed by the filename.

Create `.opencode/command/review-component.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/review-component.md"
---
description: Review component
---

Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.
Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.
```

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

---

## Command properties

Configure commands with these optional frontmatter properties:

- **description**: Brief explanation of what the command does
- **agent**: Agent to use (defaults to "build")
- **model**: Specific model to use for this command

Create `.opencode/command/code-review.md`:

```md title=".opencode/command/code-review.md"
---
description: Code review assistant
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Review the code for best practices and suggest improvements.
```

---

## Command directory

Store command files in these locations:

- `.opencode/command/` - Project-specific commands
- `command/` - Global commands in config directory

Project commands take precedence over global ones.

---

## Built-in commands

opencode includes several built-in commands:

- `/init` - Initialize project and create AGENTS.md
- `/undo` - Revert the last changes
- `/redo` - Restore reverted changes
- `/share` - Share the current conversation
- `/help` - Show available commands and keybinds

Use `/help` to see all available commands in your setup.
