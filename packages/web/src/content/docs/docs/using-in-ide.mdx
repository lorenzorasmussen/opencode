opencode works seamlessly with VS Code, Cursor, or any IDE that supports a terminal. Just run `opencode` in the terminal to get started.

---

## Features

- **Quick Launch**: Open opencode with `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux), or click the opencode button in the UI.
- **Context Awareness**: Automatically shares your current selection or tab with opencode.
- **File reference shortcuts**: Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (ie., @File#L37-42)

---

## Installation

To install opencode on VS Code and popular forks (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium):

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the integrated terminal
3. Run `opencode` - the extension installs automatically

---

### Manual Install

Search for `opencode` in the Extension Marketplace and click **Install**.

---

### Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't install:

- Ensure youâ€™re running `opencode` in the integrated terminal.
- Confirm the CLI for your IDE is installed:
  - For VS Code: `code` command
  - For Cursor: `cursor` command
  - For Windsurf: `windsurf` command
  - For VSCodium: `codium` command
  - If not, run `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search for "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" (or the equivalent for your IDE)
- Ensure VS Code has permission to install extensions
