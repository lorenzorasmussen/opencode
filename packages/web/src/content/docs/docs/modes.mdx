Modes in opencode allow you to customize the behavior, tools, and prompts for different use cases. You can switch between modes during a session or configure them in your config file.

## Built-in modes

opencode comes with two built-in modes:

### Build mode (default)

The default mode with all tools enabled. This is the standard mode for development work where you need full access to file operations and system commands.

### Plan mode

A restricted mode designed for planning and analysis. In plan mode, the following tools are disabled by default:

- `write` - Cannot create new files
- `edit` - Cannot modify existing files
- `patch` - Cannot apply patches
- `bash` - Cannot execute shell commands

This mode is useful when you want the AI to analyze code, suggest changes, or create plans without making any actual modifications to your codebase.

## Switching modes

You can switch between modes during a session using the `tab` key (or your configured `switch_mode` keybind).

## Configuring modes

You can customize modes in your `opencode.json` config file:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mode": {
    "build": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/build.txt}",
      "tools": {
        "write": true,
        "edit": true,
        "bash": true
      }
    },
    "plan": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false,
        "bash": false
      }
    },
    "review": {
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/code-review.txt}",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false,
        "bash": false,
        "read": true,
        "grep": true,
        "glob": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Mode configuration options

Each mode can be configured with the following options:

### `model`

Override the default model for this mode. Useful for using different models optimized for different tasks (e.g., a faster model for planning, a more capable model for implementation).

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "plan": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514"
    }
  }
}
```

### `prompt`

Specify a custom system prompt file for this mode. The prompt file should contain instructions specific to the mode's purpose.

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "review": {
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/code-review.txt}"
    }
  }
}
```

### `tools`

Control which tools are available in this mode. You can enable or disable specific tools by setting them to `true` or `false`.

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "readonly": {
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false,
        "bash": false,
        "read": true,
        "grep": true,
        "glob": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating custom modes

You can create your own custom modes by adding them to the `mode` configuration. For example, a documentation mode that focuses on reading and analysis:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mode": {
    "docs": {
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/documentation.txt}",
      "tools": {
        "write": true,
        "edit": true,
        "bash": false,
        "read": true,
        "grep": true,
        "glob": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available tools

The following tools can be controlled in mode configurations:

| Tool        | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `bash`      | Execute shell commands  |
| `edit`      | Modify existing files   |
| `write`     | Create new files        |
| `read`      | Read file contents      |
| `grep`      | Search file contents    |
| `glob`      | Find files by pattern   |
| `list`      | List directory contents |
| `patch`     | Apply patches to files  |
| `todowrite` | Manage todo lists       |
| `todoread`  | Read todo lists         |
| `webfetch`  | Fetch web content       |

## Use cases

Here are some common use cases for different modes:

- **Build mode**: Full development work with all tools enabled
- **Plan mode**: Analysis and planning without making changes
- **Review mode**: Code review with read-only access plus documentation tools
- **Debug mode**: Focused on investigation with bash and read tools enabled
- **Docs mode**: Documentation writing with file operations but no system commands
