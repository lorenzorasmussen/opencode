description: Control what AI agents can do in your codebase.

By default, opencode allows all operations without requiring explicit approval. The permissions system provides granular control to restrict what actions AI agents can perform in your codebase, allowing you to configure explicit approval requirements for sensitive operations like file editing, bash commands, and more.

## Configuration

Permissions are configured in your `opencode.json` file under the `permission` key. Here are the available options:

### permission.edit

Controls whether file editing operations require user approval.

- `"ask"` - Prompt user for approval before editing files
- `"allow"` - Allow all file editing operations without approval

### permission.bash

Controls whether bash commands require user approval. This can be configured globally or with specific patterns. Setting this to "ask" is the strictest mode, requiring approval for all bash commands.

## Configuration examples

### Basic permission configuration

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "edit": "ask",
    "bash": "ask"
  }
}
```

### Advanced bash permission configuration

Setting bash permissions to "ask" is the strictest mode. If you want to allow specific commands without approval, you can configure them explicitly. All other commands will require approval by default:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "edit": "ask",
    "bash": {
      "git status": "allow",
      "git diff": "allow",
      "npm run build": "allow",
      "ls": "allow",
      "pwd": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

This permissions system ensures that you maintain control over what AI agents can do in your codebase while providing flexibility for trusted operations.
