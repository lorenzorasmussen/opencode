title: Agents
description: Configure and use specialized agents in opencode.
---

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured for specific tasks and workflows. They allow you to create focused tools with custom prompts, models, and tool access.

## Using Agents

Agents are automatically available through the Task tool when configured. The main assistant will use them for specialized tasks based on their descriptions.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear descriptions** - Write specific descriptions that help the main assistant know when to use each agent
2. **Focused prompts** - Keep agent prompts focused on their specific role
3. **Appropriate tool access** - Only give agents the tools they need for their tasks
4. **Consistent naming** - Use descriptive, consistent names for your agents
5. **Project-specific agents** - Use `.opencode/agent/` for project-specific workflows

## Examples

### Documentation Agent

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "docs-writer": {
      "description": "Writes and maintains project documentation",
      "prompt": "You are a technical writer. Create clear, comprehensive documentation.",
      "tools": {
        "bash": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Auditor

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "security-auditor": {
      "description": "Performs security audits and identifies vulnerabilities",
      "prompt": "You are a security expert. Focus on identifying potential security issues.",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
