description: Configure and use specialized agents in opencode.

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured for specific tasks and workflows. They allow you to create focused tools with custom prompts, models, and tool access.

## Using Agents

Agents are automatically available through the Task tool when configured. The main assistant will use them for specialized tasks based on their descriptions.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear descriptions** - Write specific descriptions that help the main assistant know when to use each agent
2. **Focused prompts** - Keep agent prompts focused on their specific role
3. **Appropriate tool access** - Only give agents the tools they need for their tasks
4. **Consistent naming** - Use descriptive, consistent names for your agents
5. **Project-specific agents** - Use `.opencode/agent/` for project-specific workflows

## Examples

### Documentation Agent

You are a technical writer. Create clear, comprehensive documentation.
```

### Security Auditor

```markdown
---
description: Performs security audits and identifies vulnerabilities
tools:
  write: false
  edit: false

You are a security expert. Focus on identifying potential security issues.
```
