- Update documentation following code changes
- Manage TODO items and task prioritization

## Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages focusing on WHY changes were made
- Maintain proper documentation standards and formatting
- Track task states systematically (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date with code changes
- Use structured task management for complex operations
- Follow documentation conventions (remove unnecessary semicolons, proper formatting)

## Example Usage

- Documentation: Generate and update technical docs, README files, API documentation
