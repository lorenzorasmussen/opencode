## Industry Best Practices & Tips

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Follow SOLID principles**: Single responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **Apply the DRY principle**: Don't repeat yourself - create reusable functions and components
- **Use the YAGNI principle**: You aren't gonna need it - implement only what's required now
- **Write self-documenting code**: Use clear variable and function names that explain their purpose
- **Implement proper error handling**: Always handle potential error cases gracefully
- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Maintain the same naming patterns across the codebase
- **Keep functions small and focused**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Write meaningful commit messages**: Use the imperative mood, be concise but descriptive

### Testing Best Practices

- **Follow the testing pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer integration tests, and minimal end-to-end tests
- **Practice Test Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation code
- **Use the AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert for clear test structure
- **Make tests independent**: Each test should be able to run in isolation
- **Use appropriate test data**: Use factory patterns or fixtures for test data setup
- **Test for both positive and negative cases**: Verify expected behavior and proper error handling
- **Keep tests fast**: Slow tests reduce developer productivity
- **Make tests readable and maintainable**: Name tests clearly and avoid complex setup

### Performance & Optimization

- **Profile before optimizing**: Measure performance bottlenecks before making changes
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Focus on correctness first, then optimize if needed
- **Use efficient algorithms and data structures**: Understand the time/space complexity of your solutions
- **Cache appropriately**: Implement caching for expensive operations but be aware of cache invalidation
- **Minimize resource usage**: Optimize for memory, CPU, and I/O usage
- **Optimize database queries**: Use indexes, minimize N+1 queries, and optimize complex queries
- **Lazy loading**: Load resources only when needed
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse connections to databases and external services

### Security Best Practices

- **Validate and sanitize all inputs**: Never trust user input or external data
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Implement proper authentication and authorization**: Verify identity and permissions
- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Encode output appropriately**: Prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- **Use HTTPS for all communications**: Encrypt data in transit
- **Store passwords securely**: Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update libraries and frameworks

### Collaboration & Code Management

- **Use feature flags**: Enable/disable features without deployment
- **Practice continuous integration**: Merge small changes frequently
- **Write comprehensive pull request descriptions**: Explain the why and impact
- **Keep pull requests small**: Makes reviews easier and faster
- **Use code reviews effectively**: Look for logic, security, performance, and maintainability
- **Maintain clean git history**: Use meaningful commit messages and rebasing when appropriate
- **Branch strategically**: Use feature branches and consider Gitflow if appropriate
- **Document architectural decisions**: Keep Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Documentation Best Practices

- **Document complex logic**: Comments should explain "why" not "what"
- **Maintain API documentation**: Keep it updated with code changes
- **Write effective README files**: Include setup, usage, and contribution instructions
- **Use consistent documentation style**: Follow team standards for documentation
- **Document breaking changes**: Clearly communicate changes that affect users
- **Include examples**: Show how to use public APIs and complex features
- **Keep documentation close to code**: Makes it easier to keep up-to-date
- **Automate documentation generation**: Use tools to extract documentation from code

### User Forum Tips & Techniques

- **Debug systematically**: Use a scientific approach - form hypothesis, test, observe, adjust
- **Use your IDE effectively**: Learn keyboard shortcuts, refactoring tools, and debugging features
- **Log strategically**: Include context in logs but don't over-log sensitive information
- **Use debuggers over print statements**: They're more efficient and less intrusive
- **Refactor regularly**: Keep code clean and address technical debt incrementally
- **Pair program for complex problems**: Two minds can solve difficult issues faster
- **Learn from others' code**: Read open source projects to see different approaches
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Create scripts to handle common development operations

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

## description: "Task list template for feature implementation"

# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test\_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test\_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test\_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test\_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test\_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test\_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

### Parallel Example: User Story 1

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
