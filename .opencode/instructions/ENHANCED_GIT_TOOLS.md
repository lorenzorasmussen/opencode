## üéØ Practical Git Workflows

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Start day - check status
opencode run "check git status"

# Make changes and stage
opencode run "stage all changed files"

# Commit work
opencode run "commit with message 'Implemented user authentication'"

# Push to remote
opencode run "push changes to origin"
```

### Feature Branch Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
opencode run "create new branch feature-login"

# Switch to it
opencode run "switch to branch feature-login"

# Work and commit
opencode run "stage all changed files"
opencode run "commit with message 'Added login form'"

# Push feature branch
opencode run "push branch feature-login to origin"

# Later: merge back to main
opencode run "switch to branch main"
opencode run "pull changes from origin"
```

### Code Review Workflow
```bash
# Check what changed
opencode run "show diff between main and feature-branch"

# Review commit history
opencode run "show commits in feature-branch not in main"

# See detailed changes
opencode run "show details for commit abc123"
```

### Repository Analysis
```bash
# Recent activity
opencode run "show last 20 commits"

# Author contributions
opencode run "show commits by author Alice in last month"

# Branch overview
opencode run "list all branches"

# File changes
opencode run "show what files changed in last commit"
```

## üîç Advanced Git Operations

### Time-based Queries

opencode run "show commits between 2024-01-01 and 2024-01-31"
```

### Author Filtering
```bash
opencode run "show commits by John"
