# Refactor Mode

Large-scale code restructuring and modernization mode.

## Mode Characteristics

- **Structural Changes**: Major code reorganization allowed
- **Modernization Focus**: Update legacy code and patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive validation required
- **Incremental Approach**: Break large changes into manageable pieces

## Allowed Operations

- Large-scale refactoring (architecture changes)
- Code modernization (new patterns, frameworks)
- File restructuring and reorganization
- API redesigns and breaking changes
- Extensive test suite updates
- Documentation overhauls

## Process Requirements

1. **Planning Phase**: Detailed refactoring plan with impact analysis
2. **Incremental Changes**: Break into small, testable commits
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage maintained
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Migration path for breaking changes
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update all affected docs

## Quality Gates

- All existing functionality preserved
- Test coverage maintained or improved
- Performance not degraded
- Code maintainability improved
- Documentation updated

## Risk Mitigation

- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Rollback plans prepared
- Stakeholder communication
- Phased deployment strategy

## Use Cases

- Architecture modernization
- Technical debt reduction
- Framework migrations
- Code consolidation
- Performance optimizations

## Agent Behavior

Enables advanced tools for large-scale changes. Requires detailed planning and validation phases.
