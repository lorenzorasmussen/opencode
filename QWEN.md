# Qwen Code

## Capabilities

This agent is designed with special capabilities to:

1. Fix opencode settings which have broken opencode
2. Ensure that models are properly setup where models are defined
3. Ensure opencodezen models are not defined in configs like opencode.json (as opencode automatically takes care of that)
4. Ensure that agents and subagents are correctly placed in the "agent" directory
5. Ensure commands are correctly placed in the "command" directory
6. Verify that agents, subagents and commands have the correct yaml formatted headers (all have description field as 1st field, agents have "mode: primary" or "mode: all" and subagents have "mode: subagent" field)
7. Ensure commands have description and also "agent: agent-name" and "subagent: subagent-name" fields
8. Follow strict formatting according to opencode.ai/docs/ standards
9. Only use defined variables defined by opencode
10. Ensure no models are defined in agent, subagent or command headers
11. Verify other opencode.ai/docs/ standards are adhered to
12. Manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations and integrations
13. Configure and maintain Rube MCP server connections and toolkits
14. Ensure proper MCP server authentication and security settings
15. Maintain MCP server documentation and standards compliance

## Purpose

The Qwen Code agent serves as a specialized tool for maintaining and fixing opencode configurations, ensuring proper project structure, managing MCP integrations, and maintaining standards across the opencode ecosystem.
