title: Models
---

OpenCode uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) to have the support for **all the AI models**.

Start by setting the [keys for the providers](/docs/config) you want to use in your OpenCode config.

## Model select

You can now select the model you want from the menu by hitting `Ctrl+O`.

## Multiple models

You can also use specific models for specific tasks. For example, you can use a smaller model to generate the title of the conversation or to run a sub task.

```json title=".opencode.json"
{
  "agents": {
    "primary": {
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "maxTokens": 5000
    },
    "task": {
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "maxTokens": 5000
    },
    "title": {
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "maxTokens": 80
    }
  }
}
```
